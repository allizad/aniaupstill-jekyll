## Ania is a performer, creator, educator and clown.

Ania has worked across many aspects of theatre, specializing in collaborative and ensemble work. An enthusiastic Shakespearean, they have directed and performed in more than half of the canon. Ania has recently been inspired by the joy and wonder of clown, both as a performer and a teacher.

Ania identifies as queer and genderqueer, is passionate about queer representation and centers their theatrical practice around LGBTQIA+ characters and stories, utilising clown, drag, physical theater and music. Ania has performed an original queer clown show, Piesexual, at The Tank’s Pridefest, at various cabaret and showcases for new work (including Undiscovered Countries’ November 2018 showcase) and in Hypokrit theater’s R+J: A Reimagination of Romeo + Juliet.

Ania graduated in 2018 from Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theater, and before that spent six years in New Zealand working as a director, performer and producer. They are currently training at the Circus Warehouse in LIC, NY in Partner Acrobatics and Tumbling.
