Ania believes that clown is an important and ultimately humanitarian discipline, teaching us to be vulnerable, responsive and present to the moment. They particularly enjoy teaching, and love helping their students discover the clown(s) that live within each of them. When they are in NYC they teach weekly drop-in classes at The Friend Ship. They also can be booked to teach longer form workshops.

Ania has performed at a number of cabaret and circus events in NYC and are a part of the Circus Warehouse’s Intensive program. They have also gone on two trips  with Clowns Without Borders in Palestine. [Read more about their experience in Palestine](https://clownswithoutborders.org/projects/palestine-three-year-program/). They are interested in how clown can be applied to other disciplines and are planning a Clowning for Consent workshop for January 2020 that uses clown to teach tactics for bystander intervention.

Ania studied clown at Dell’Arte International with Lauren Wilson, Stephanie Thompson and Joe Krienke. Ania has also taken workshops with Red Bastard in Bouffon and Avner the Eccentric in Eccentric Performance.
