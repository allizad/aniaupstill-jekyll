Ania studied clown at Dell’Arte International with Lauren Wilson, Stephanie and Joe. They have also taken workshops bouffon Eric (?) [Red Bastard] (Bouffon) and Avner the Eccentric, among others.

They have performed at a number of cabaret and circus events in NYC and are a part of the Circus Warehouse’s Intensive program. They have also volunteered twice to teach and perform clown with Clowns Without Borders in Palestine. [Read more about their experience in Palestine](https://clownswithoutborders.org/projects/palestine-three-year-program/).

Ania believes that clown is an important and ultimately humanitarian discipline, teaching us to be vulnerable, responsive and present to the moment. They particularly enjoy teaching clown, and love helping their students discover the clown(s) that live within each of them. When they are in the city they teach weekly drop-in classes in NYC at The Friend Ship and teach occasional longer form workshops. They are interested in how clown can be applied to other disciplines and are planning a Clowning for Consent workshop for January 2020 that uses clown as a disruptive technique to defuse potentially violent situations.
